It have already:

* HTTP ready route handlers.
* Basic Swagger Docs and their partition.
* Simple and useful validator.
* Ready `knex` files and directories with examples.
* `Bookshelf` base model with pretty good _filter_ and _orderBy_ implementation. How to use it you can read in docs or in [MS API Guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#9-collections).
* Setup basic environment variables.
* Feature based file structure.
* Ready `.editorconfig`.
* Ready `webpack.config.js`.

# TODO:

* Errors factory for features.
* Errors according to Node 10.
